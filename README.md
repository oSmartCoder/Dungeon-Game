# Dungeon-Game
This game was made for a school assignment, but it is also a passion project of mine. I hope you enjoy it!

I will be updating this project from time to time, but for now, this game is still in development.


## Installation
### Running Executable
1. Click on the green button that says '<> Code' and at the bottom of the dropdown click on 'Download ZIP'.
2. Once you have downloaded the ZIP file, locate the file and make sure to extract the contents of the compressed file.
3. Upon completion, click on the extracted file two times until you reach the inner contents of the folder.
4. Run `main.exe`. If you are prompted with an antivirus preventing you from running the program, you can safely disable it temporarily.
    - If the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen appears, click on 'More info' and 'Run anyway'.
5. Done! You should hopefully be able to run the game without any errors.

### Running Python File
1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (3.8 or later) and added to PATH (you can do this by checking the PATH option during installation)
2. Open Windows PowerShell and type in the following commands: (you can skip this step if you already have `pygame` and `pytmx` installed)
   
   ```
   pip uninstall pygame
   ```
   ```
   pip install pygame-ce
   ```
   ```
   pip install pytmx
   ```
3. Once completed, you may now run the `main.py` file (located in the root directory)
   - If any error occurs, double-check if you have followed each of these steps correctly. Also, feel free to open an issue if you think there is an error preventing you from running the program.
